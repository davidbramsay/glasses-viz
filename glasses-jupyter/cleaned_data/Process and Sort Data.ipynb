    "(2)  then we run the openface feature extractor with `FeatureExtraction.exe -f \"E:\\data_cap_val_2\\patrick_1\\GoPro\\video.mp4\" -2Dfp -3Dfp -pdmparams -pose -aus -gaze`.  This will give all kinds of features from openface, timestamped in secs relative to start of video, one row per frame.\n",

This file will be generated with this script.  Helpers to estimate gopro start time are included here.\n",
    "- folders for each user test by day, i.e. `david_1, patrick_1, david_2, juliana_1, etc`\n",
    "- - each folder will have a `video_eyeratio_final.csv` file from the blink script run on the video\n",

    "- - each folder will have a `glasses_sessions.p` file, which includes the relevant sorted data as continuous sessions from the glasses (at 10Hz, blink data is 1kHz).  This file will generate that data.\n",
