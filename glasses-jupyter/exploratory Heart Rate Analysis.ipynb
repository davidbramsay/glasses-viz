    "\"To sense the BCG at the head in a portable and wearable manner, we use a MEMS tri-axial digital accelerometer. Because head BCG is in the range of 10mGp−p, a highly sensitive and low noise accelerometer is needed. We choose Bosch's BMA180 accelerometer for its 14-bit resolution and 0.69mGRMS of measured noise at 10Hz bandwidth with ±2G range.\"\n",
